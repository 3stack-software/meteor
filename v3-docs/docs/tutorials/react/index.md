This tutorial is where to start learning the basics of [Meteor](https://meteor.com) with [React](https://react.dev/).
In this tutorial, we will build a To-Do app that will insert and fetch data from MongoDB, authenticate users with passwords.

We will create, update, and remove tasks using Methods, and present them with real-time updates using Publications and Subscriptions.
