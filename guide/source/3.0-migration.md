title: Migrating to Meteor 3.0
description: How to migrate your application to Meteor 3.0.
---

> **This guide will be created as we get closer to the Meteor 3.0 beta release.** We are also evaluating new documentation platforms to improve our users' experience.

## What's the status of version 3.0?

**Latest version:** `3.0-alpha.19` <br/>
**Node.js version:** `20.9.0 LTS`

Meteor 3.0 is in alpha and not recommended for production. You can check the "[Release 3.0 Pull Request](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/12359)" to see what is being changed.

## How to prepare for version 3.0?

You can follow the guide "[How to migrate to Meteor Async in Meteor 2.x](/prepare-meteor-3.0.html)" to help you prepare your application for the new version by starting to use async methods.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Fibers?

Meteor was designed at a time when callback hell was a development issue, so it was decided by the team at the time
to use [fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science)) to make building applications much more straightforward with synchronous-looking code.
The Meteor fibers implementation is based on [node-fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers), which is no longer supported as of NodeJS v16.0.0.

The main reason for this migration is to remove the dependency on fibers and make Meteor
compatible with the latest versions of Node.js.

For more information about fibers, you can check this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxaOGDqVPKw)
from Ben Newman and this Stack Overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40865153/6688795).

### Will MongoDB Collection Methods be removed?

No, they will not be removed.

On the client side, all can remain the same. You can use both sync and async methods,
but on the server side, you can only use the methods with the `*Async` suffix.

For example:

```js
// 2.x in the server side

Meteor.methods({
  myMethod() {
    const doc = MyCollection.findOne({ _id: '123' });
  }
});


// v3.0 in the server side

Meteor.methods({
  async myMethod() {
    const doc = await MyCollection.findOneAsync({ _id: '123' });
  }
});
```

Methods that will be _only_ available in the *client* are:
  -`findOne`;
  -`insert`;
  -`remove`;
  -`update`;
  -`upsert`;

If you leave any code using one of these methods in the server side, you will get an error,
like this one below:

```bash
findOne is not available on the server. Please use findOneAsync instead.
```

### How to test Meteor 3.0?

You can create a new Meteor 3.0 project by running the command below:

```bash
meteor create my-new-project --release 3.0-alpha.19
```

### How to update from version 2?

You can update your Meteor 2.x project by running the command below inside your project folder:

```bash
meteor update --release 3.0-alpha.19
```

### How to follow the progress on version 3?

The best way to follow the progress is by checking the "[What's left until an official Meteor 3.0?](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions/12865)" discussion. We have also been sharing constant updates on [this topic](https://forums.meteor.com/t/fibers-public-roadmap-and-meteor-3-0/59627/84) in our forum.

### When will Meteor 3.0 be ready?

Our plan is to release the beta version by the end of Q4 2023. An official version will depend a lot on user feedback, but we aim to release it by the end of Q1 2024.

### How is the package migration going for the React packages?

The team considers it done.

It is important to note that it is unnecessary to migrate your front-end code to async.
You can still use the sync methods on the client side.

But to maintain isomorphic code, you can use the async methods on the client side.

In those cases, we have implemented `suspense` hooks so that you can use the async methods.

For example:

```js

// you can write like this:

import { useTracker, useSubscribe } from 'meteor/react-meteor-data'
function Tasks() {
  const isLoading = useSubscribe("tasks");
  const { username } = useTracker(() => Meteor.user())
  const tasksByUser = useTracker(() =>
          TasksCollection.find({username}, { sort: { createdAt: -1 } }).fetch()
  );


if (isLoading()) {
  return <Loading />
}

  // render the tasks
}


// or like this:

import { useTracker, useSubscribe } from 'meteor/react-meteor-data/suspense'
function Tasks() { // this component will suspend
  useSubscribe("tasks");
  const { username } = useTracker("user", () => Meteor.userAsync())
  const tasksByUser = useTracker("tasksByUser", () =>
          TasksCollection.find({username}, { sort: { createdAt: -1 } }).fetchAsync()
  );


  // render the tasks
}

```

`useFind` in the client will remain the same.

You can check the [react-meteor-data docs](https://github.com/meteor/react-packages/tree/master/packages/react-meteor-data) for more information
and these blog posts [part 1](https://dev.to/grubba/making-promises-suspendable-452f) [part 2](https://dev.to/grubba/new-suspense-hooks-for-meteor-3ddg) for a in-depth look on how we made those changes.


### How is the package migration going for the Blaze package?

The team considered it almost done.

It is important to note that migrating your front-end code to async is unnecessary.
You can still use the sync methods on the client side.

But to maintain isomorphic code, you can use the async methods on the client side.

Since this [PR](https://github.com/meteor/blaze/pull/413) was released with Blaze 2.7. Blaze supports async in their views.

You can check the [Blaze docs](https://www.blazejs.org/api/spacebars#Async-states) for
more information on how to handle async states.

[@radekmie](https://github.com/radekmie) made two great posts about making blaze async. Both are worth reading:
  - [On Asynchronicity in Blaze](https://radekmie.dev/blog/on-asynchronicity-in-blaze/);
  - [On Asynchronicity in Blaze (again)](https://radekmie.dev/blog/on-asynchronicity-in-blaze-again/);


### How is the package migration going for the XYZ package?

We have made the migration for the packages in the core(listed in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/Grubba27/d8e46c6ec39d1c197e4f723f4f9a81cc)).

We, the Meteor Team, want to bring these three packages to the core and migrate them as they are important for the Meteor ecosystem:
  - `percolate:migrations` - [GitHub](https://github.com/percolatestudio/meteor-migrations);
  - `littledata:synced-cron` - [GitHub](https://github.com/percolatestudio/meteor-synced-cron);
  - `matb33:collection-hooks` - [GitHub](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection-hooks);


For those packages that are not in the core but are maintained by the [community](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages),
we hope that the community can work on them, but if for some reason that is not possible,
you can always ping us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/meteor-community/shared_invite/zt-28aru814j-AwswQGt2D1xIXurvmtJvug) or in the [Forums](https://forums.meteor.com/).
